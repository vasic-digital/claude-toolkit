# Provider Aliases — User Guide

`claude-providers` turns every LLM API key you keep in your keys file into its
own Claude Code alias, pointed at that provider's strongest model. It reuses the
multi-account toolkit's machinery (shared plugins/history, automatic
`.bashrc`/`.zshrc` wiring) so a provider alias behaves like a normal `claudeN`
account, just talking to a different model backend.

It is **fully dynamic**: the provider list, base URLs, transports, and model IDs
are all derived at run time from your keys file + the [models.dev](https://models.dev)
catalog. Nothing is hardcoded. Re-run it any time to pick up new keys or refresh
existing providers.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

| Need | Why | Install |
|------|-----|---------|
| The toolkit installed | provides `lib.sh`, the alias file, sync-state | `bash scripts/install.sh` |
| A keys file | one `export NAME_API_KEY=...` per provider | `~/api_keys.sh` (default) or pass `--keys-file` |
| `jq`, `python3`, `curl` | catalog parse + resolve + fetch | system package manager |
| `claude-code-router` *(only for routed providers)* | translate Anthropic↔OpenAI/Gemini | `npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router` |
| `submodules/LLMsVerifier` built *(optional)* | full "does this model work?" verification | see §7 |

Your keys file is the **only** place secrets live. `claude-providers` reads the
variable *names* from it (without executing it) to discover providers, and the
launch wrapper reads the *value* at the moment you start a session. No key is
ever written into the repo, the alias file, or the per-provider env files.

## 2. Quick start

```bash
claude-providers sync         # discover + create/refresh all provider aliases
source ~/.local/share/claude-multi-account/aliases.sh   # or open a new shell
claude-providers list         # see what you got
deepseek                      # launch Claude Code on DeepSeek's strongest model
```

## 3. Commands

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `claude-providers sync` *(default)* | Discover every LLM key, resolve it via models.dev, verify (if available), and create/refresh one alias per provider. Idempotent — safe to run repeatedly. |
| `claude-providers list` | Table of installed provider aliases: alias name, provider, transport, strong + fast model. |
| `claude-providers show <id>` | Print the resolved env file for one provider. |
| `claude-providers remove <id>` | Remove the alias + env file; back up and remove the config dir. |
| `claude-providers add --from-key VAR --id PROVIDER` | Register a key→provider mapping (when a key's name doesn't match models.dev), then sync. |

### Useful flags

- `--keys-file PATH` — use a different keys file (default `~/api_keys.sh`).
- `--no-verify` — skip verification; create aliases regardless.
- `--offline` — don't fetch models.dev; use the local cache (errors if none).
- `--dry-run` — print what would change; write nothing.

## 4. How a provider alias is named and what it runs

- **Alias name** defaults to the models.dev provider id (`deepseek`, `groq`,
  `mistral`, …). Want something shorter like `dseek`? Set it in
  `scripts/providers/overrides.json` (see §6).
- **Strong model** → Claude Code's main model (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`). Chosen as the
  provider's most capable: reasoning-capable first, then newest, then largest
  context.
- **Fast model** → Claude Code's background model (`ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`),
  chosen as the cheapest tool-call-capable model.
- **Transport**:
  - `native` — provider speaks the Anthropic API directly (models.dev `npm` is
    `@ai-sdk/anthropic`). The alias runs `claude` with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` /
    `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` set.
  - `router` — provider is OpenAI-compatible / Gemini. The alias launches
    through `claude-code-router` (`ccr code`), which translates the protocol.

## 5. Config dirs, plugins, and shared state

Each provider gets `~/.claude-prov-<id>`, which symlinks the same shared items
as your accounts (`projects`, `todos`, `plugins`, `settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`,
…). So **every plugin you have in `claude1..N` is available in every provider
session**, and history/projects are unified. `sync` also force-enables the
always-on set in shared settings: **superpowers, systematic-debugging,
frontend-design, code-review**.

Provider dirs are deliberately **excluded from account auto-detection**, so they
never get merged into your real accounts' auth/identity and never interfere with
`claude-unify` or `claude-add-account`. Your existing `claudeN` aliases keep
working exactly as before, and you can still create new accounts the same way.

## 6. Overrides — `scripts/providers/overrides.json`

Per-provider pins. Empty by default. Any field you set wins over the
models.dev-derived value:

```json
{
  "deepseek": {
    "alias": "dseek",
    "transport": "native",
    "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic",
    "strong_model": "deepseek-reasoner",
    "fast_model": "deepseek-chat"
  }
}
```

This is how you (for example) promote DeepSeek to its native Anthropic endpoint
(`/anthropic`) instead of routing it, or give it the short alias `dseek` — all
without touching any code.

### `scripts/providers/key-aliases.json`

Maps a key variable name to a models.dev provider id, for the cases where the
name differs (e.g. `CODESTRAL_API_KEY` → `mistral`, `ZAI_API_KEY` → `zai`). Use
`claude-providers add --from-key VAR --id PROVIDER` to append entries.

## 7. Verification (optional, via LLMsVerifier)

By default `sync` does a best-effort check (an HTTP probe of the provider's
`/models`, when a key + network are available) and otherwise marks a provider
`unverified` — the alias is **still created** (full verification is opt-in).

For authoritative verification ("does this model exist and can it see my code?")
build the LLMsVerifier submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init --depth 1 submodules/LLMsVerifier
cd submodules/LLMsVerifier && go build -o bin/model-verification ./llm-verifier/cmd/model-verification
```

Once `submodules/LLMsVerifier/bin/model-verification` exists, `sync` uses it: a
provider that **fails** verification is recorded but its alias is **not**
activated. (Requires the Go toolchain; the build reads keys from your keys file.)

## 8. Known limitation — default session color

The original goal was for each provider session to default its `/color` to
**purple**. Investigation of the installed Claude Code (v2.1.178) found that
`/color` is **session-scoped and TUI-only — it is never persisted to disk**, and
there is no settings key, hook, or environment variable to set a default color.
So this cannot be automated with the current Claude Code.

**Workaround:** type `/color purple` at the start of a provider session.
`purple` is a valid color. If a future Claude Code adds a persistable color
setting, `sync` will seed it automatically.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| `provider 'X' needs claude-code-router` | Routed provider, ccr not installed → `npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router`. |
| `$NAME_API_KEY is empty` | The key isn't set in your keys file. |
| `offline and no models.dev cache` | Run `claude-providers sync` once online to populate the cache. |
| A key didn't become an alias | It's `unmapped` (no models.dev match) or classified `vcs`/`infra`. Map it with `add`, or check `scripts/providers/evidence/mapping-report.md`. |
| Alias missing after sync | `source ~/.local/share/claude-multi-account/aliases.sh` or open a new shell. |

## 10. Remote distributed deployment & heavy testing

For heavy testing that depends on **real production services**, the toolkit can
boot the full LLMsVerifier System on a remote host (registered in
`config/containers/nezha.env`) via the `containers` submodule + podman, and run
real per-provider verification through it.

- **Deployment guide + boot procedure:** `config/containers/llmsverifier/README.md`
  (services, ports, the exact `podman-compose` boot steps, and every
  root-caused deployment fix).
- **What runs:** the `llm-verifier` API + an observability tier (prometheus +
  grafana with an auto-provisioned datasource & dashboard + node-exporter).
- **Heavy testing:** the bundled `model-verification` tool runs a real
  "Do you see my code?" check against each provider's live API:
  ```bash
  ssh <user>@<host> 'podman run --rm --env-file ~/helix-system/llmsverifier/.env \
    llm-verifier-mv:nezha --provider deepseek --model deepseek-chat --verbose'
  ```
- **Evidence:** every verification + deployment claim is captured under
  `docs/qa/20260616-infra/` (proofs, sweeps, security, observability).

### z.ai Coding Plan (zai-coding-plan)

The [z.ai](https://z.ai) Coding Max-Yearly Plan provides access to Zhipu AI's
flagship GLM models through a dedicated coding-optimized API endpoint. This is
separate from the base z.ai plan — the Coding Plan endpoint uses
`api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` and includes **Free access** to `glm-5.2` (the
flagship with 1M context and reasoning) and `glm-4.7` (the fast model with 204k
context, reasoning, and tool_call support), among others.

#### How the alias works

The key variable `ZAI_API_KEY` in your keys file is mapped to the
`zai-coding-plan` provider ID via `scripts/providers/key-aliases.json`. An
override in `scripts/providers/overrides.json` pins the strong model to
`glm-5.2` and the fast model to `glm-4.7`, which are the optimal choices for
coding workloads on this plan.

Transport is **router** — the alias launches through `claude-code-router`
(`ccr code`), which translates the Anthropic protocol to the OpenAI-compatible
z.ai API.

#### Models available on the Coding Plan

All models are free on the Coding Max-Yearly Plan:

| Model | Context | Reasoning | Tool Call | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **glm-5.2** | 1M tokens | Yes | Yes | Flagship — newest, most capable |
| glm-5.1 | — | Yes | Yes | Intermediate |
| glm-5-turbo | — | — | — | Turbo variant of glm-5 |
| glm-5 | — | — | — | Base generation 5 |
| **glm-4.7** | 204k tokens | Yes | Yes | Fast model — reasoning + tool_call |
| glm-4.6 | — | — | — | Mid-range |
| glm-4.5-air | — | — | — | Lightweight |
| glm-4.5 | — | — | — | Base model |

**Note on glm-5.2 rate limits:** The Coding Max-Yearly Plan enforces a Fair
Usage Policy on the flagship model: rapid-fire requests (e.g., repeated
programmatic calls at short intervals) may trigger a temporary rate limit (error
code `1313`). Normal interactive use via `zai-coding-plan` at human pace is
unaffected.

#### Setup

Everything is already configured on this host, but for a fresh install:

1. Ensure `ZAI_API_KEY` is exported in your keys file (`~/api_keys.sh`).
2. Run `claude-providers sync` to discover the key and create the alias.
3. `source ~/.local/share/claude-multi-account/aliases.sh` (or open a new shell).
4. Run `zai-coding-plan` to start a Claude Code session on glm-5.2.

No additional manual steps are needed — the key alias, model override, and
endpoint are all defined in the provider config files.

#### Usage example

```bash
zai-coding-plan                    # launch Claude Code on glm-5.2
zai-coding-plan -p "explain this function"   # non-interactive print mode
```
