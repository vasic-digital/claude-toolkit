#!/usr/bin/env bash
# claude-sync-state.sh — Fast (no rsync) sync of the .claude.json projects /
# session index across every Claude Code account. Called by the cma_run alias
# wrapper before launch (pull) and after exit (push) so sessions/memory
# created in one account are immediately visible to all others.
#
# Distinct from claude-unify.sh: unify is the heavy one-shot merger of the
# whole shared store; this is the lightweight per-launch state hook.
#
# Modes:
#   claude-sync-state pull <account-dir>   Merge every account's .claude.json
#                                          into <account-dir>'s file.
#   claude-sync-state push <account-dir>   Merge <account-dir>'s freshly-
#                                          written .claude.json into all other
#                                          accounts' files.
#   claude-sync-state all                  Merge across every detected account.
#
# In every mode, each account keeps its OWN auth/identity keys (`userID`,
# `oauthAccount`, `firstStartTime`, `claudeCodeFirstTokenDate`) untouched —
# everything else (projects map, MCP server status, UX state, caches) is
# unioned across accounts. See CMA_CLAUDE_JSON_PRIVATE_KEYS in lib.sh.
