# test_mutation_residue.sh — refuse to ship a mutation left behind by testing.
#
# Why this exists (a real incident, not a hypothetical):
#
# Proving a test has teeth means temporarily breaking the code it guards and
# confirming the test fails — mutation testing. The danger is the restore step:
# it is manual, and a mutation that survives it is a silent, shipped defect that
# every test still passes over, because the mutation's whole purpose was to be
# invisible to everything except the one test being probed.
#
# During the v1.23.1 launch-path work an independent reviewer mutated
#   submodules/claude-code-router/cmd/ccr/launch.go
#     -  if surface == "app" {
#     +  if surface == "app" && false {
# to prove TestLaunchRejectsAppSurface had teeth. `&& false` makes the branch
# unreachable — the guard is dead, `ccr <profile> app` would silently launch the
# terminal agent instead of refusing. It was caught by a manual scan. This test
# replaces that luck with a gate.
#
# Scope: production sources only. Test files are excluded deliberately — a test
# may legitimately contain the literal string "MUTATED" as fixture data (e.g.
# internal/gateway/wiring_test.go asserts a config value is NOT overwritten by
# using "MUTATED" as the sentinel).
