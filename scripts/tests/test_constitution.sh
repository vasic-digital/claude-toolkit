# The constitution checks are static/read-only against the real repo, so this
# test:
#   1. runs the verifier against the REAL repo (every check must pass or SKIP
#      here) with PROOF_DIR redirected into the sandbox, asserting exit 0 and
#      a written evidence file;
#   2. points CMA_REPO_ROOT at a controlled fixture repo in the sandbox and
#      asserts a well-formed fixture passes;
#   3. breaks one precondition in the fixture (removes GEMINI.md, violating
#      the §11.4.157 doc lockstep) and asserts the verifier exits nonzero and
#      records the missing doc in its evidence.
