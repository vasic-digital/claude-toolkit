# test_ccr_conformance.sh — static, no-network conformance between the launch
# grammar the toolkit SPEAKS and the grammar the bundled Go router UNDERSTANDS.
#
# Why this exists: the v1.23.0 JS->Go router swap passed the whole suite while
# the router launch was broken end-to-end. The wrapper invoked
# `ccr default-claude-code`, the real binary rejected every unknown first arg
# with `Profile "<arg>" was not found or is disabled.` (exit 1), and the only
# tests covering the router path used fake `ccr` stubs that silently `exit 0`
# on anything they didn't recognise. Stubs can only ever certify the stub.
#
# So: derive the REQUIRED set by scanning scripts/lib.sh for `ccr <word>` in
# command position, derive the SUPPORTED set by parsing the `case` arms of the
# router's top-level dispatch, and assert required ⊆ supported. Pure text
# analysis — no build, no network, no launch.
